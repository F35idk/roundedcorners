rounded window corners for gala
==============
just add roundedcorners to gala's plugin directory and run patch.sh before building and installing gala and things should work.  
this plugin was made to work with gala running outside of elementary os, and thus doesnt work quite perfectly otherwise. if you still wish to use it inside of elementary os, use the "non-standalone" branch.
